# Cruelty-Free Slimeballs
gelatin-alternative inspired recipes for slimeballs

[Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-addons/cruelty-free-slimeballs)

Supports 1.18.2 - 1.20.4 (if you download from source- might take a bit for me to push releases). Should support modded crops if they tag their crops properly - let me know if it doesn't.

This datapack adds 3 recipes for crafting Slimeballs, based on carrageenan, pectin, and xanthan gum. Helpful for folks who play on Peaceful, don't like dealing with slimes, or just find it a pain to find slimes in the first place. (No, weak baby panda sneezes are not a viable source of slimeballs imo - I tried.)

 

Here are the different recipes! They all make 3 slime balls.

Carrageenan - 1 Dried seaweed + 2 buckets of milk

Pectin - 1 pectin-rich fruit (defined as either an apple or citrus) + 2 buckets of water

Xanthan gum - 2 buckets of water and 1 of the following: wheat, sugar cane, milk, or corn (if you are using a mod that adds corn and it's tagged in a way I planned for)

 

All recipes have built-in support for Fabric common tags and there is an attempt at built-in support for Forge common tags, however I don't actually know that it'll work because Forge doesn't document their common tags like Fabric does.

 

The recipes also implement some new Fabric & Forge common tags - I don't really expect anyone to use these as a basis for anything, but it was very convenient to just say "all these fruits are citrus, and all these fruits are pectin-rich, and these things can be used to make xanthan gum" and yknow, might as well put it in the common tags section. But hey, maybe if I figure out how to mod Minecraft and not just make datapacks I'll actually make a (fabric) mod version of this to add like, jams or something. I dunno.

 

If this datapack is lacking compatibility with a mod (fabric or forge), let me know and I can try to look into it! Or you can do it yourself if you want, the github source is linked! Honestly I can't promise forge compatability, it's wild in here.

(vampy's first minecraft datapack! wowie!)
